## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I had saved a 'three different ways to center a div' image i found online, and had the chance to use it in this challenge. I usually go with the common display flex way, but this one worked! Just glad I had it saved.


```css
.faq-box {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, 20%);
}
```
